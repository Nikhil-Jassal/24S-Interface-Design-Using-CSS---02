        <!--song lyrics-->
        <span>Take a little walk to the edge of town</span><br>
        And go across the tracks<br>
        Where the viaduct looms<br>
        <span>Like a bird of doom</span><br>
        As it shifts and cracks<br>
        Where secrets lie in the border fires<br>
        In the humming wires<br>
        Hey man, you know<br>
        <span>You're never coming back</span><br>
        Past the square, past the bridge<br>
        Past the mills, past the stacks<br>
        On a gathering storm comes<br>
        A tall handsome man<br>
        In a dusty black coat with<br>
        <span>A red right hand</span><br>
        He'll wrap you in his arms<br>
        Tell you that you've been a good boy<br>
        He'll rekindle all the dreams<br>
        It took you a lifetime to destroy<br>
        He'll reach deep into the hole<br>
        Heal your shrinking soul<br>
        But there won't be a single thing<br>
        That you can do<br>
        <span>He's a god, he's a man</span><br>
        He's a ghost, he's a guru<br>
        They're whispering his name<br>
        Through this disappearing land<br>
        But hidden in his coat<br>
        Is a red right hand<br>
        You don't have no money?<br>
        He'll get you some<br>
        You don't have no car?<br>
        He'll get you one<br>
        <span>You don't have no self-respect</span><br>
        You feel like an insect<br>
        Well don't you worry buddy<br>
        'cause here he comes<br>
        Through the ghettos and the barrio<br>
        And the bowery and the slum<br>
        A shadow is cast wherever he stands<br>
        Stacks of green paper in his<br>
        <span>Red right hand</span><br>
        You'll see him in your nightmares<br>
        You'll see him in your dreams<br>
        He'll appear out of nowhere but<br>
        <span>He ain't what he seems</span><br>
        You'll see him in your head<br>
        On the TV screen<br>
        And hey buddy, I'm warning<br>
        You to turn it off<br>
        He's a ghost, he's a god<br>
        He's a man, he's a guru<br>
        You're one microscopic cog<br>
        In his catastrophic plan<br>
        Designed and directed by<br>
        <span>His red right hand</span><br>
